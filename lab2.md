## Part Three: Reflection
Things I learned in this lab that I didn't learned before was JUnit Testing and creating URL website. I learned how to write test code using assert methods to debug and diagnose symptom in the code work which I then applied into CSE12 PA2 where we start to use JUnit testing and implement hidden test. I also learned to create URL website from VS code and creating functions to add on to the site using comands in the URL interface.
