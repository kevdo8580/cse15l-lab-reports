The command ```history``` was used in the docsearch file of lab 3 and purpose was to get all the past commands written within the terminal similar to seeing your search history but instead it's the past commands as shown above. This is useful to troubleshoot to see which command caused an error, learn and improve commands, and security to see a potential breach in the system. ```history``` also have numeric number to shoow in what order the command was excuted. These numeric number are useful in excuting a specific command which is shown in ```$ ![number]``` section.
